# Code Challenge Samples

I've checked in some files into the ig github project under app/samples/* .  These are going to be our "code challenges".  Basically, they are pieces of the larger application that we can work on now.  Will start with one person running point on different challenges, but might change to using multiple branches or working an area as a team.  

Feel free to add the foundation for any others we might need.

### Build Parameters

We need a way to set a variable like IP address during the development build so that the javascript can use it. 

### Status Bar

An area that can be updated with status of on-going processes or information the user might want but doesn't need a popup for. 

### Date Picker

Simple pop-up calendar to pick and date and have the date be entered into a text box. 

### Drag Menu
 
 A popup menu that allows for rearranging of the elements by drag and drop.
 
###  Field Validation

Validate a field on key press or tab away to make sure it meets some criteria.  If not, color the border red and provide an explanation of the problem. 

### Custom Directive

Use a custom directive to display the calendar
